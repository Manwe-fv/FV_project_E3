# FV_project_E3

MQ2's E3 with fixes and edits custom to the Firiona Vie Project server.

PLEASE NOTE: Due to classic client limitations, some E3 functionality will not work. This is due to a lack of XTargets, visibility of debuffs on mobs, etc. Check issues for a full list.

Download the base version of MQ2+E3 from the link below and apply the files in this repository over them.
